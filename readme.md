# 📊 Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project showcases how I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** from scratch to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service.  
I used the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) and implemented the complete workflow independently as part of my **Prodigy Infotech Data Science Internship**.

## 🔍 What I Did & Learned
✅ Explored and analyzed real-world marketing data.  
✅ Preprocessed and encoded categorical variables effectively.  
✅ Built and visualized a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn.  
✅ Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.  
✅ Understood feature importance and how Decision Trees make decisions.  
✅ Reflected on potential improvements like pruning and hyperparameter tuning.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **End-to-end ML pipeline:** Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- **Visualizations:** Plotted feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, and the Decision Tree itself.
- **Explainability:** Understood which features most strongly influence purchase predictions.
- **Performance:** Achieved solid accuracy with a clear, interpretable model.

## 📊 Dataset Details
- **Source:** UCI ML Repository
- Contains data like customer age, job, marital status, education, previous interactions, etc.
- Used to predict whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.

---

## ✅ Results
Built a transparent, interpretable Decision Tree model that helps identify key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

## 📌 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
- Trying advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for better performance.
- Deploying the model with a simple web app interface.
